# NLPNeuralNetwork

The is a NLP (Natural Language Processing) project that classify the text comments from kickstarter and Indiegogo based on their sentiments to further detect low-quality projects.

It constains a Python code implementation file which pre-processed the unstructured text data which contains numerous emojis, symbols, punctuations, etc; applied several text embedding libraries such as fastText and GloVe to obtain vector representations of words; Trained convolutional neural networks (CNN) with various combinations of architectures and embedding methods; selected the best model by comparing their accuracies and AUROC.

The pdf file summerize all the methidology and decision making process throughout the model construction process.
